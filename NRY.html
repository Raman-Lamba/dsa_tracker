            This rule stands for Never Repeating Yourself.
            <br>
            As a programmer we sooner or later think that there is 
            too much content for us to learn so we use this rule to 
            learn and practice more things in a short amount of time.

        </p>
        <p>
            As per this rule we never type same code twice and even if we do same problem we try to do it in a different coding stye

        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            We use this rule to be faster and more efficient.
